## About MSP430
[MSP430](https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/msp430f169)  MSP430 family are ultralow power microcontrollers consist of several devices featuring different sets of peripherals targeted for various applications. The architecture, combined with five low power modes is optimized to achieve extended battery life in portable measurement applications. The device features a powerful 16-bit RISC CPU, 16-bit registers, and constant generators that contribute to maximum code efficiency. The digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) allows wake-up from low-power modes to active mode in less than 6 μs.

Key features:
- Low Supply-Voltage Range: 1.8 V to 3.6 V
- Ultralow Power Consumption 
    -  Active Mode: 330 μA at 1 MHz, 2.2 V 
    -  Standby Mode: 1.1 μA 
    -  Off Mode (RAM Retention): 0.2 μA
- 16-Bit RISC Architecture
- 125-ns Instruction Cycle Time
- Three-Channel Internal DMA
- 12-Bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Converter With Internal Reference, Sample-and-Hold, and Autoscan Feature   
- Dual 12-Bit Digital-to-Analog (D/A) Converters With Synchronization
- 16-Bit Timer_A With Three Capture/Compare Registers
- 16-Bit Timer_B With Three or Seven Capture/Compare-With-Shadow Registers
- On-Chip Comparator
- Serial Communication Interface (USART0), Functions as Asynchronous UART or Synchronous SPI or I2C Interface
- Serial Communication Interface (USART1), Functions as Asynchronous UART or Synchronous SPI Interface
- Supply Voltage Supervisor/Monitor With Programmable Level Detection
