## MCP430 - Photoresistor Light Sensor Module
The Photoresistor Light Sensor Module can detect the presence or absence and the relative strength of visible light.

KEY FEATURES:
Detects visible light spectrum
Analog output
3.3 and 5V compatible

The photoresistor is in series with a 10K resistor to create a voltage divider.  The output of the module is analog and is at a high voltage when no light is striking the sensor and the voltage lowers as the light intensity increases.  Under strong lighting, the output will approach ground.  When the light is completely blocked, the output will approach Vcc.
